Ontario Inpatient Hospital Demand Forecasting (Canada)

This project analyses long-term inpatient hospital discharge trends in Canada, with a focused case study on Ontario. The goal is to establish a reliable baseline forecast to support medium-term healthcare planning.

Project objective

Understand historical inpatient demand patterns

Identify structural disruptions

Produce a baseline forecast for planning purposes

Data

Source: Canadian hospital inpatient discharge data

Coverage: 1995–2024

Frequency: Annual

Geography: Canada, with province-level analysis

COVID-19 years are treated as a structural disruption and excluded from model training.

Methodology

Data cleaning and validation

Exploratory Data Analysis to assess trends, concentration, and stability

ETS (Error–Trend–Seasonal) modelling with additive trend

Sensitivity analysis using a damped trend specification

Key findings

Ontario drives national inpatient demand trends

Pre-COVID demand follows a stable, gradual growth pattern

Post-COVID volumes deviate from baseline expectations

Forecast results are robust to alternative trend assumptions

Output

Five-year baseline forecast for Ontario inpatient discharges

Planning-oriented interpretation, not operational prediction

Intended use

This analysis is designed to support healthcare planning discussions, workforce considerations, and capacity assessment under normal operating conditions.
